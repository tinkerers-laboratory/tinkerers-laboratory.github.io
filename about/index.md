Tinkerers’ Lab (*TL*)  is a **24x7** technical facility open to all IITB students to encourage them to go beyond their curriculum and explore technology as hobby, as fun, and start tinkering, building and innovating to convert creative ideas into actual engineering products.

The Lab was set up with support from the class of 1975 has been in operation since March 2014 with the idea that it will complement the engineering education at IITB with some much needed hands on tinkering and thus foster innovation.
