##### About the Talk
A talk on NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto and Beyond was organized by the Students' Technical Activities Body (STAB) on 13th March 2016. The talk was presented by Planetary Scientist, Dr. Henry Throop from Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, USA. Dr. Henry Throop spoke of this NASA spacecraft mission, from its development and construction, through its launch in 2006, to its successful encounter with Pluto and the Kuiper belt. He talked about how the team resolved last moment connectivity issues with ease and explained the importance of the various calculations and precautions that need to be taken care of when someone launches a satellite. The audience later asked questions to which Dr. Throop answered with a lot of enthusiasm. He also had personal discussions with students about their work and made several suggestions. He later paid a visit to Tinkerers' Lab where he was briefed about the idea behind the lab by the STAB Overall Coordinator. Dr. Throop also joined students at the Astro GC and looked at celestial bodies explaining the science of the night sky to the enthusiastic crowd.
