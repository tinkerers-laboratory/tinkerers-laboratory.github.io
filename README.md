## How to contribute
Create a fork from the source on github and then clone your local repo.
Clone your fork and add a tracking branch which can always have the last version of `tinkerers-laboratory.github.io`.

    git clone https://github.com/username/tinkerers-laboratory.io
    git remote add ec https://github.com/tinkerers-laboratory/tinkerers-laboratory.github.io
    git fetch ec
    git branch ec-master --track ec/master
    git checkout ec-master
    git pull

Create a branch from the last dev version of the tracking branch above.
Let's call this branch `new_blog`.

    git branch new_blog
    git checkout new_blog

Add and commit and push your changes at your default remote which is usually called origin.

    git add ...
    git commit ...
    git push origin new_blog

Make sure your branch is udpated with the latest changes in ec/master. Online repositories prefer if you will rebase your branch to the updated changes, i.e. no extra commit of `Merge branch 'master'`.

    git checkout ec-master
    git pull
    git checkout new_blog
    git rebase ec-master

If you see any conflicts you can resolve them using a standard and easy way.
Open the file(s) and look for these pointers `>>>>`. They will show both changes which are conflicting.
Remove what is unnecessary and commit and push your changes.

    git commit -am "Resolved conflict"
    git push origin new_blog

After you have finished pushing all your changes you are ready to make a pull request from github. You just need to press the green button from your github repo and write a title and a small description of what you are sharing with us.

After the pull request has arrived, the developers will review it and give you comments, and eventually merge it.


## How to write a blog post

Blog posts live in the `_posts` folder. They have specific filename format:

    yyyy-mm-dd-title.<ext>

`<title>` should be lowercase of the words of your title seperated by a '`-`' ( hyphen ). 

`<ext>` should be the file-format extension. You can write the blog post in HTML ('html' extension) or Markdown ('md' extension). Markdown is a simple and intuitive markup language (preferrable over HTML). [Here's](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) a good tutorial for it. If you do use HTML, keep it to simple tags like `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<img>` and such.

For eg.

    2016-03-07-first-post.md

Content of the file should include this Front Matter on top:

    ---
    layout: post
    comments: true

    assets_dir: /assets/first-post
    title: First Post
    excerpt: Small description for main page
    author: Your Name
    category: [Electronics, Robotics]
    tags: [Raspberry Pi, Arduino]
    ---

        ...
        content
        ...

Change the `title`, `excerpt`, `author`, `category` and `tags` field appropriately. They will be used to generate title and description of your blog on the homepage, and will add it to corresponding category and tag-wise pages.

There is no need to add title or date in the content, they will be added automatically.

If you want to add images and/or other files, put them in a folder named `/assets/<title>`, eg. something like `/assets/first-post`. Make sure to add this folder name to `assets_dir` field like shown in the example. Then when linking to the images/files write the link in this format `{{page.assets_dir}}/image.jpg}}`. A markdown example would be: 

    [This is a pdf]({{page.assets_dir}}/file.pdf)
    ![This is an image]({{page.assets_dir}}/image.jpg)

So just fork, add a post and send a PR, or just push it directly here if you have access!
